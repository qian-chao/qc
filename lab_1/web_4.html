		<h2>Selectors</h2>

		<pre><h3>
			As elements are added to a web page, they may be styled using CSS. A selector 

			designates exactly which element or elements within our HTML to target and 

			apply styles (such as color, size, and position) to. Selectors may include a 
		
			combination of different qualifiers to select unique elements, all depending 

			on how specific we wish to be. For example, we may want to select every 

			paragraph on a page, or we may want to select only one specific paragraph on 

			a page.

			Selectors generally target an attribute value, such as an id or class value, 

			or target the type of element, such as h1 or p.

			Within CSS, selectors are followed with curly brackets, {}, which encompass 

			the styles to be applied to the selected element.<h3/>
