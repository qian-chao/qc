			Once an element is selected, a property determines the styles 

			that will be applied to that element. Property names fall after 

			a selector, within the curly brackets, {}, and immediately 

			preceding a colon, :. There are numerous properties we can use, 

			such as background, color, font-size, height, and width, and new 

			properties are often added. In the following code, we are defining 

			the color and font-size properties to be applied to all p elements.
