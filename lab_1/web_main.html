                        HTML, HyperText Markup Language, gives content structure and meaning by defining that content as, 

			for example, headings, paragraphs, or images. CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a presentation 

			language created to style the appearance of content¡ªusing, for example, fonts or colors.

                        The two languages¡ªHTML and CSS¡ªare independent of one another and should remain that way. CSS 

			should not be written inside of an HTML document and vice versa. As a rule, HTML will always
 
			represent content, and CSS will always represent the appearance of that content.


                        With this understanding of the difference between HTML and CSS, let¡¯s dive into HTML in more detail.
