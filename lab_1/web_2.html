		<h2>Tags</h2>
<hr>
		<pre><h3>
			The use of less-than and greater-than angle brackets surrounding an element

			creates what is known as a tag. Tags most commonly occur in pairs of opening 
			
			and closing tags.

			An opening tag marks the beginning of an element. It consists of a less-than 
			
			sign followed by an element¡¯s name, and then ends with a greater-than sign; 
				
			for example, <div>.
			A closing tag marks the end of an element. It consists of a less-than sign 
			
			followed by a forward slash and the element¡¯s name, and then ends with a 
			
			greater-than sign; for example, </div>.
			The content that falls between the opening and closing tags is the content 
		
			of that element. An anchor link, for example, will have an opening tag of 
		
			<a> and a closing tag of </a>. What falls between these two tags will be the 
		
			content of the anchor link.
